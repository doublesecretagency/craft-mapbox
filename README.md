# Mapbox plugin for Craft CMS

**Maps in minutes. Powered by the Mapbox API.**

---

### Includes easy-to-use Address Fields

When managing your Craft data, each location can be set with a convenient Address field.

### Create flexible Dynamic Maps

Add markers, use popups, style maps, change marker icons, and much more.

The plugin features a powerful [universal API](https://plugins.doublesecretagency.com/mapbox/dynamic-maps/universal-api/) which works nearly identically across **JavaScript, Twig, and PHP!**

```twig
{# Get the entries #}
{% set entries = craft.entries.section('locations').all() %}

{# Place them on a dynamic map #}
{{ mapbox.map(entries).tag() }}
```

For more information, see the [full dynamic maps docs...](https://plugins.doublesecretagency.com/mapbox/dynamic-maps/)
